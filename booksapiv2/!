This is a simple sample restful api to play with a book catalog.

Copy the source dist from the dist dir and to your venv to install. For example:

cp dist/booksapi-2022.1.23.1.tar.gz /usr/src/
    * cd /usr/src
    *pip install booksapi-2022.1.23.1.tar.gz

*This will bring up a running Flask app listening on port 5000.
*API help is provided at http://<IP>/help if using the associated K8 manifests.
